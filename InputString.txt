The U.S. House of Representatives approved a criminal contempt report against Steve Bannon, the ally of former President Donald Trump, for defying a subpoena from a House panel probing the Jan.  attack.
The  to  vote in the Democratic-controlled chamber was largely along party lines, with nine GOP members joining Democrats. It followed a day of contentious debate, with Democrats and Republicans trading barbs.
Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., led the effort for the Republicans, criticizing the probe and its efforts to investigate a private citizen.
"Steve Bannon was a private citizen before, after and during January ," Banks said. "So why is the select committee interested in Steve Bannon? It's simple. He's a Democrat party boogeyman."
But Banks' statement backed up the crux of the committee's argument, with its lawmakers claiming that as a private citizen, executive privilege does not apply to Bannon.
For his part, Banks was one of five Republicans initially appointed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to serve on the panel, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ultimately rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. As a result, McCarthy pulled all five, and decided to largely boycott the effort.
