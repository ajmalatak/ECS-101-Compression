Airline passengers are bringing guns to the airport in numbers never seen before, and it is a "huge problem," the Transportation Security Administration chief told CNN.
Security and law enforcement officials are at the same time dealing with an unprecedented surge in belligerent passengers who are straining the systems designed to keep air travel safe.
"We've had many more incidences where there are passenger disturbances both in checkpoints and onboard aircraft. That makes it more important that there are no guns involved," TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in an interview.
And with weeks left in the year -- including the busy Thanksgiving and Christmas travel seasons -- Pekoske says he thinks the number of confiscated weapons reflects an American population that is increasingly armed.
"I think more people are carrying weapons, just generally across the country, and then whatever is happening across the country we see reflected in our checkpoints," he said. "As a passenger, I don't want a another passenger flying with me with a gun in their possession."
